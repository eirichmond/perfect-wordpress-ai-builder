# Create WordPress Header Notice Plugin

Create a WordPress plugin that displays customizable header notices to website visitors with the following specifications:

## Core Functionality

### Display Requirements
- Display notices at the top of every page, positioned above navigation
- Place the markup before the closing `</body>` tag
- Use absolute positioning to ensure the notice appears at the very top
- Make the notice full width of the device/viewport
- Ensure the notice doesn't interfere with existing site layout

### Notice Types & Styling
Create three predefined notice types with distinct visual styling:

1. **General Notice**
   - White text on green background
   - Used for general announcements, updates, or positive messages

2. **Warning Notice**
   - White text on black background
   - Used for important information or alerts

3. **Error Notice**
   - Yellow text on red background
   - Used for critical alerts or urgent messages

### Content Structure
Each notice should support:
- **Title**: Main heading text (required)
- **Subtitle**: Additional descriptive text (optional)
- Both title and subtitle should be clearly distinguishable in the design

### Administrative Controls
- Only administrators (users with `manage_options` capability) can create, edit, or delete notices
- Provide an intuitive admin interface in the WordPress dashboard
- Allow administrators to preview notices before publishing

### Expiration System
- Include an optional expiration date and time field
- If expiration is set, automatically hide the notice after the specified date/time
- If no expiration is set, display the notice indefinitely until manually disabled
- Provide timezone-aware expiration handling

## Technical Requirements

### Backend Administration
- Create an admin page under Settings or Tools menu
- Include form fields for:
  - Notice title (required)
  - Notice subtitle (optional)
  - Notice type selection (general/warning/error)
  - Expiration date and time (optional)
  - Enable/disable toggle
- Implement proper form validation and sanitization
- Save settings using WordPress options API

### Frontend Display
- Check if notice is active and not expired
- Inject notice markup before `</body>` tag
- Ensure notice is responsive across all device sizes
- Make notice visually prominent but not disruptive to user experience

### Security & Performance
- Implement proper nonce verification for form submissions
- Sanitize all user inputs
- Escape all outputs
- Use WordPress coding standards throughout
- Optimize for performance (minimal database queries)

## User Experience Features

### Visual Design
- Make notices eye-catching but professional
- Ensure text is easily readable with proper contrast
- Consider adding subtle animations or transitions
- Include a dismiss option for users (if appropriate)

### Responsive Behavior
- Ensure notices display properly on mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Maintain readability across all screen sizes
- Consider how the notice affects the overall page layout

## Additional Considerations

### Accessibility
- Ensure proper color contrast ratios
- Use semantic HTML structure
- Include appropriate ARIA labels if needed

### Flexibility
- Design the system to be easily extensible
- Consider how additional notice types could be added in the future
- Think about internationalization/translation support

## Success Criteria
The plugin should be:
- Easy for administrators to use
- Visually effective for site visitors
- Performant and secure
- Compatible with most WordPress themes
- Professional in appearance and functionality

Please implement this plugin following WordPress best practices, ensuring clean, maintainable code that integrates seamlessly with the WordPress ecosystem.
